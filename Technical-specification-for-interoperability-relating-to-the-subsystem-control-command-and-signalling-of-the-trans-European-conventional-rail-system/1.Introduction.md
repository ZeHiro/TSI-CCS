#1.   INTRODUCTION

##1.1.   Technical scope

This TSI concerns the control-command and signalling subsystem, shown in the list in point 1 of Annex II to Directive 2001/16/EC. It is referred to in this document as ‘control-command subsystem’.

Further information about the control-command subsystem is provided in Chapter 2 (Subsystem definition and scope).

##1.2.   Geographical scope

The geographical scope of this TSI is the trans-European conventional rail system as described in Annex I to Directive 2001/16/EC.

##1.3.   Content of this TSI

In accordance with Article 5(3) of Directive 2001/16/EC, this TSI:

(a) indicates its intended scope (part of the network or rolling stock referred to in Annex I to the Directive; subsystem or part of subsystem referred to in Annex II to the Directive) — Chapter 2 (Subsystem definition and scope);

(b) lays down essential requirements for the control-command subsystem concerned and its interfaces vis-à-vis other subsystems — Chapter 3 (The Essential Requirements Of The control-command subsystem);

(c) establishes the functional and technical specifications to be met by the subsystem and its interfaces vis-à-vis other subsystems. If necessary, these specifications may vary according to the use of the subsystem, for example according to the categories of line, hub and/or rolling stock provided for in Annex I to the Directive — Chapter 4 (Characterisation of the subsystem);

(d) determines the interoperability constituents and interfaces covered by European specifications, including European standards, which are necessary to achieve interoperability within the trans-European conventional rail system — Chapter 5 (Interoperability constituents);

(e) states, in each case under consideration, the procedures for the assessment of conformity or suitability for use. This includes in particular the modules defined in Decision 93/465/EEC or, where appropriate, the specific procedures to be used to assess either the conformity or the suitability for use of interoperability constituents and EC verification of subsystems — Chapter 6 (Assessment of conformity and/or suitability for use of the constituents and verification of the subsystem);

(f) indicates the strategy for implementing the TSI. In particular, it is necessary to specify the stages to be completed in order to make a gradual transition from the existing situation to the final situation in which compliance with the TSI shall be the norm — Chapter 7 (Implementation of the TSI control-command);

(g) indicates, for the staff concerned, the professional qualifications and health and safety conditions at work required for the operation and maintenance of the subsystem concerned, as well as for the implementation of the TSI — Chapter 4 (Characterisation of the subsystem).

Moreover, in accordance with Article 5(5) of Directive 2001/16/EC, provision may be made for specific cases for each TSI; these are indicated in Chapter 7 (Implementation of the TSI control-command).
Lastly, this TSI also comprises, in Chapter 4 (Characterisation of the subsystem), the operating and maintenance rules specific to the scope indicated in sections 1.1 (Technical scope) and section 1.2 (Geographical scope).
